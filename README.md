Symphony
========

A Symfony project created on October 22, 2016, 10:46 pm.


The website based on Symfony I pretty much entirely coded for Welcom', when I came in the association. I entered quite late (months after the elections) and I'm not a member of the board, so I'm not credited in the poster.
It was my first experience in "webdesign" (don't think it was such a bad job, for something that was never even properly drawn or anything before) and website creation (after a short introduction to Symfony in class) and the working prototype took me one week during the holidays to complete, and then around two more days, spread across two months to get to v0.7 which was put online at www.welcom-evry.com .
There was still a bit of cleaning to do, a few missing functionnalities which should now mostly be fixed in this initial commit for v0.9.
For 1.0, I still need to write a few comments here and there, add backup CSS for older browsers (even though most of the site won't work for browsers way too old...), and fix a design problem in the "tri-news" (three news displayed next to each other in columns) that appears on small devices.

v0.9 : 12/28/2016 




Need PHP >5.4 to work, and package php-sqlite (the release on welcom-evry.com works doesn't work with sqlite, it's just for local debugging)
